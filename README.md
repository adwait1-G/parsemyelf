This Repository started as the source of a tool called parsemyelf - a simple ELF parser I wrote to understand ELF Format in detail. 

I have plans of writing other tools which will help me understand Program Analysis better. 

This repository is the source repository of all those I write.

**parsemyelf** : This is an ELF parser written in C++

**debugme**: Not under development right now - just a plan. The aim is to write a simple debugger to understand how a debugger works.
