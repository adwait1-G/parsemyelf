# PME - ParseMyElf

PME is a 64-bit ELF parser. 

I started writing the tool in C. All the C sourcecode is in the **C_src** directory. 

I have started rewriting the complete tool in C++, because I felt it is more advantageous. All the details are present in **src** directory. 

The C version is no longer under development.
